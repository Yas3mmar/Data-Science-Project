# Heart-Disease-Project
## Description
The Heart-Disease-Project is my project for the Introduction to Data Science course at PNU, which covers key concepts such as:
- How to load a CSV file in Python
- Data description
- Basic summary
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data preprocessing
- Machine learning models, specifically in supervised learning
- Conclusion based on accuracy and AUC/ROC scores

I'm sharing this project to support anyone interested in data science and to provide a practical example of real Python code in action. Enjoy exploring❤️
